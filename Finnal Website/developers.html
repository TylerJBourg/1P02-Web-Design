<h2> About Everest Studios</h2>
<p> “Everest Studios was founded on the belief that when you buy a game you should receive a completed game with all the content included in one purchase no DLC, no microtransactions, no loot boxes; one purchase should equal one amazing experience” – Jason Coburn </p>


<p>The studio was founded in 2011 by a group of former developers that were fed up with the current gaming market and how games were published and developed so they decided to start their own studio that would-be consumer friendly. </p>
